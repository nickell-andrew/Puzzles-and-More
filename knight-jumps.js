//Using the JavaScript language, have the function KnightJumps(str) 
//read str which will be a string consisting of the location of a knight 
//on a standard 8x8 chess board with no other pieces on the board. The 
//structure of str will be the following: "(x y)" which represents the 
//position of the knight with x and y ranging from 1 to 8. Your program 
//should determine the number of spaces the knight can move to from a 
//given location. For example: if str is "(4 5)" then your program should 
//output 8 because the knight can move to 8 different spaces from 
//position x=4 and y=5. 

// Advanced challenges are worth 15 points and you are not timed for 
//them. Use the Parameter Testing feature in the box below to test your 
//code with different arguments.
