/* you and a coworker are building a game that is played on a near infinite hex grid

She is going to design the layout of the grid and she'll supplies you with a function
that determines whether any hex space is passable or impassable

You must find the shortest path between two given hex points, passing only through
passable locations

Inputs: 2 location in a plane (hex grid)  / grid / function that checks passability (memory look up (constant time))

analyze Time and Space Complexity and (optimize if possible) */
